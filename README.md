Blackjack

##Introduction

Blackjack is a classic casino card game with the goal to to get a total of 21. Suits don't matter in this version 
with all JACK/QUEEN/KING/ACE being worth 10.

###Notes

The game will stop when you don't want to get hit or when your hand is too large.
If you win your prize money depends on the other winners. If only you win, and no body else wins, you get your bet by six fold more, 
or if everyone wins, you get your bet amount.

###Difficulty Levels

You are in easy mode: the game will only use one deck. The bots are extremely simple and rely on guessing more.
    
You are in medium mode: the game will use six decks (to prevent card counting). The bots will use basic logic and calculations to make their choice

You are in hard  mode: the game will use six deck. The bots have seeming omniscience and will likely win
